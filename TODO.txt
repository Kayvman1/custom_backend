Build LRHU
Build acceptor thread
Build handler thread/ logic 
write it so you can use macros to switch between build and test runs

instead of accepting a connection on a socket signal that a test client has started. 

wrap two buffer into a class have both the client and server have access to this and then this contains metadata to facilate metadata

server runner just parse args and calls server

test function for server that instanciates a wrapper class 

server get pair creates a new pair to simulate multiple connections 

Get rid of the while true in server and change it to semaphore that waits for a connection

// consider what happens if you want to retransmit whats in a socket when a conenction fails.
// Each client might have listening thread and an execute
// control packet vs streaming packets
// learn byte protcol for web
// learn http protocol standards
// terminate called without an active exception
// select or poll reading out of socket
//  Spin reading?


//Where is the handshake handled?


// TODO SET THREAD AS BLOCKING SO YOU CAN'T READ PACKET SEGMANTS
// What to do when whole message isnt sent


DO I HAVE TO HAVE A RING_BUFFER INTILIZE CALL NOW ?
